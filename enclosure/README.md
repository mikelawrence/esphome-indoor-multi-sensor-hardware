# ESPHome Parking Assistant Enclosure

<img src="meta/ESPHome-Multi-Sensor-Enclosure-Render.png" width="100%">

This 3D printable enclosure is designed to go into a corner. It has a two-piece adjustable angle rear mount. Just change the ```Wall_Angle``` parameter. Both the speaker enclosure and back mount have TPU gaskets. The speaker gasket is to seal the enclosure and prevent vibrations from the speaker causing a buzzing sound. The TPU back mount gasket seals the SEN66 and provides a small amount of pressure to keep the SEN66 from moving.

The front body snaps into the back body and holds the PCB in place. A small cable connects the SEN66 to the PCB must be in place before snaps the bodies together.

The enclosure is designed in Fusion and is available [here](https://github.com/mikelawrence/ESPHome-Indoor-Multi-Sensor/raw/refs/heads/main/enclosure/ESPHome-Multi-Sensor-Enclosure.f3z).

If your are just looking for easy to print step file look in the ```3d-printing folder```. There a step file for each part and a nicely formatted Bambu Studio file with three plates ready to print.

## DFRobot C4001 SEN0609 Module
I couldn't find a step model of this Radar so I made one. Here is the [Fusion model](https://github.com/mikelawrence/ESPHome-Indoor-Multi-Sensor/raw/refs/heads/main/enclosure/DFRobot-C4001-SEN0609.f3z) and a [STEP model](https://github.com/mikelawrence/ESPHome-Indoor-Multi-Sensor/raw/refs/heads/main/enclosure/DFRobot-C4001-SEN0609.step).

## Hi-Link Electronics LD-2450 Module
The LD2450 Module I found were missing the front antennas and back header so I added these to the model from Hi-Link Electronics. Here is the [Fusion model](https://github.com/mikelawrence/ESPHome-Indoor-Multi-Sensor/raw/refs/heads/main/enclosure/HLK-LD2450-3D.f3z) and the [STEP model](https://github.com/mikelawrence/ESPHome-Indoor-Multi-Sensor/raw/refs/heads/main/enclosure/HLK-LD2450-3D.step).
